Do

Harpooner

comes
,
the
trouble
you
spoke
of
,
Mr.
Slocum
,
and
we
'll
make
short
shift
of
it
.
It
's
better
to
crush
such
things
at
the
start
than
let
them
make
headway
.
Shall
I
wake
up
the
First
and
Fourth
,
sir
?
We
might
need
their
help
.
No
,
let
them
sleep
.
I
'm
well
able
to

this
alone
,
Mr.
Slocum
.
Well

So

to-day

You

No

and
I

to
till
this
ship
is
full
of
ile
.
You

further
no'the
with
the
ice
before

The
ice
is
breaking
up
.
The
grub

now
is
rotten
.
It
's
good
enough
fur
ye
.
Better
men
than

We

You

No
;
and
the
law
courts
'll
say
we
was
right
.
To
hell
with
your
law
courts
!
We
're
at
sea
now
and
I
'm
the
law
on
this
ship
!
And
every
mother
's
son
of
you
what
do
n't
obey
orders
goes
in
irons
.
Then
we
're
agoin
'
to
mutiny
and
take
the
old
hooker
home
ourselves
.
Ai
n't
we
,
boys
?
Hold
still
!
You
's
found
out
it
ai
n't
safe
to
mutiny
on
this
ship
,
ai
n't
you
?
And
now
git
for'ard
where
ye
belong
,
and--[drag
him
with
you
.
And
remember
,
the
first
man
of
ye
I
see
shirkin
'
I
'll
shoot
dead
as
sure
as
there
's
a
sea
under
us
,
and
you
can
tell
the
rest
the
same
.
Git
for'ard
now
!
Quick

[
Best
get
up
on
deck
,
Mr.
Slocum
,
and
see
to
it
they
do
n't
try
none
of
their
skulkin
'
tricks
.
We
'll
have
to
keep
an
eye
peeled
from
now
on
.
I
know

em
.
Yes

There

Do

It

all
past
and
gone
.
Oh

n't
bear
it
!
I
ca
n't
bear
it
any
longer
!
Ca
n't
bear
what
,
Annie
?
All
this
horrible
brutality
,
and
these
brutes
of
men
,
and
this
terrible
ship
,
and
this
prison
cell
of
a
room
,
and
the
ice
all
around
,
and
the
silence
.
