I
wanted
to
talk
to
you
.
I
could
have
talked
to
you
from
the
hall
.
You
're
silly
to
take
chances
just
now
.
You
'll
be
stayin
'
a
while
now
,
Fred
?
I
'll
take
a
walk
down
the
road
.
I
'm
needin
'
a
drink
to
clear
my
wits
.
You
wo
n't
be
long
,
Father
?
And
please
don't--you
know
.
Sure
who
would
n't
get
drunk
with
all
the
sorrows
of
the
world
piled
on
him
?
Honestly
,
Eileen
,
your
father
is
the
limit
.
I
do
n't
see
how
you
stand
for
him
.
He
's
the
most
selfish
--
--
Sssh
!
You
must
n't
,
Fred
.
He
's
not
to
blame
.
He
just
does
n't
understand
.
Do
n't
!
Let
's
not
talk
about
him
now
.
We
wo
n't
have
many
more
evenings
together
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
Did
father
or
the
Doctor
tell
you
--
--
Everything
there
was
to
tell
,
I
guess
.
You
must
n't
worry
,
Fred
.
Please
do
n't
!
It
'd
make
it
so
much
worse
for
me
if
I
thought
you
did
.
I
'll
be
all
right
.
I
'll
do
exactly
what
they
tell
me
,
and
in
a
few
months
I
'll
be
back
so
fat
and
healthy
you
wo
n't
know
me
.
Oh
,
there
's
no
doubt
of
that
.
No
one
's
worrying
about
your
not
getting
well
quick
.
It
wo
n't
be
long
.
We
can
write
often
,
and
it
is
n't
far
away
.
You
can
come
out
and
see
me
every
Sunday--if
you
want
to
.
Of
course
I
will
!
Why
do
you
act
so
funny
?
Why
do
n't
you
sit
down--here
,
by
me
?
Do
n't
you
want
to
?
I--I
'm
all
flustered
,
Eileen
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
doing
.
Poor
Fred
!
I
'm
so
sorry
I
have
to
go
.
I
did
n't
want
to
at
first
.
I
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
on
father
and
the
kids--especially
little
Mary
.
And
then
the
doctor
said
if
I
stayed
I
'd
be
putting
them
all
in
danger
.
He
even
ordered
me
not
to
kiss
them
any
more
.
So
I
've
got
to
go
and
get
well
,
do
n't
you
see
?
Yes--it
's
better
.
I
'll
miss
the
kids
so
much
.
Taking
care
of
them
has
meant
so
much
to
me
since
mother
died
.
But
I
'll
miss
you
most
of
all
,
Fred
.
Fred
!
Why--why
did
n't
you
kiss--what
is
it
?
Are
you--afraid
?
Oooh
!
No
!
What--what
d'you
mean
?
No
,
no
,
you
must
n't
!
I
was
wrong
.
The
doctor
told
you
not
to
,
did
n't
he
?
Please
do
n't
,
Fred
!
It
would
be
awful
if
anything
happened
to
you--through
me
.
But
you
can
kiss
me
on
the
forehead
,
Fred
.
That
ca
n't
do
any
harm
.
It
seems
so
silly--being
kissed
that
way--by
you
.
(
_She
gulps
back
a
sob
and
continued
to
attempt
to
joke
.
_
)
I
'll
have
to
get
used
to
it
,
wo
n't
I
?
